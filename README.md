# Google-Maps-Clone

## Project Overview

The **Where2Meet** project aims to provide an innovative solution for groups of friends, colleagues, or family members seeking the ideal location to meet up and spend time together. By leveraging a custom-built Google Maps clone, this project utilizes advanced **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** to analyze various factors that contribute to selecting the best hangout spots for more than two people.

## Initial Plan

The initial plan for the Where2Meet project encompasses several key components:

### 1. Google Maps Clone

We will create a clone of Google Maps that integrates seamlessly with our application. This clone will include essential mapping features such as:

- **Interactive Map Interface**: Users can navigate through an interactive map to explore various locations and amenities.
- **Location Search**: Users can search for specific places, types of venues (restaurants, parks, cafes), and activities to facilitate their meeting arrangements.

### 2. AI-Powered Recommendations

To enhance the user experience, the project will incorporate AI algorithms to analyze user preferences, historical data, and group dynamics. Key features include:

- **Preference Analysis**: Users can input their preferences (e.g., cuisine type, atmosphere) and the AI will suggest locations that best fit their collective tastes.
- **Smart Grouping**: The AI will assess the distance and convenience for all participants, recommending meeting spots that minimize travel time and maximize enjoyment for the group.

### 3. Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

Integrating GIS technology will enable the project to analyze spatial data effectively. This will include:

- **Distance Calculation**: The GIS component will calculate distances between users' current locations and potential meeting spots, allowing for better-informed decisions.
- **Demographic Data Analysis**: By incorporating demographic information and location-based data, the application can recommend venues that cater to the specific needs and interests of the group.

### 4. User Collaboration

The application will allow users to collaborate in real time, making it easy for groups to discuss options and finalize plans. Features may include:

- **Group Polling**: Users can vote on suggested locations, ensuring that everyone's preferences are considered.
- **Chat Functionality**: A built-in chat feature will facilitate communication between users while discussing meeting arrangements.

## Conclusion

The Where2Meet project, powered by a Google Maps clone, aims to revolutionize the way groups of people select hangout locations by utilizing AI and GIS technology. By prioritizing user preferences and enhancing collaborative decision-making, this application will make meeting planning easier and more enjoyable for everyone involved. 

As we move forward with development, we aim to create a tool that not only simplifies logistics but also enriches social interactions by ensuring that friends and family gather in the best possible locations. Stay tuned for updates on our progress!
